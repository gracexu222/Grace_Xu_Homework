1.  why here has data rename.

const {

data: apiData,
loading,
error,
} = useApi("https://sssjsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts");

uses object destructuring to extract values returned by the useApi custom hook and assigns them to variables. Let’s break down what’s happening, specifically focusing on why data is assigned to apiData.

Why data: apiData?
When the hook returns this object:

javascript
Copy code
{
data: someData,
loading: trueOrFalse,
error: errorMessageOrNull
}
You can use object destructuring to pull out specific values, like this:

const { data, loading, error } = useApi(url);
However, if you want to rename the data variable to something more descriptive (like apiData), you can do so by using the data: apiData syntax:

javascript
Copy code
const {
data: apiData, // Rename 'data' to 'apiData' for clarity
loading,
error,
} = useApi(url);
Why Rename?
data is a generic name and might conflict with other variables in your component.
apiData makes it clear that this variable specifically holds data from an API call.
